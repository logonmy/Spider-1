## PURPOSE
collect all the comments of a movie called "A quiet place" from Rottentomatoes, and analise the data to obtain useful information.

## Methods  
1. analise the data 'Grades' given by audience   
2. use k-means to build the cluster 

## Tools
1. Scripy
2. Panda
3. matplotlib
4. sklearn.cluster

## Process
1. To collect all comments of a movie from ‘rottentomatoes’ ---- Scrapy(python3) used
2. As some comments did not give a grade, to clean the raw data and finalise dataset--- ‘Panda’(python3) used

3. To describe, process those data and build a Chart--- ‘matplotlib’(python3) are used.
